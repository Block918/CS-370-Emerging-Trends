# CS-370-Emerging-Trends

We were given a starter code for this assignment and asked to implement in a deep learning algorithm in order for our intelligent agent to solve the pathfinding problem. 
This course has broadened my understanding of the computer science world with the artificial intelligence side of things. Problems as a computer scientist can be intimidating sometimes but I like to break the problem down to get a good understanding of it before trying to solve it. Computer scientists matter a great deal to society nowadays due to the fact almost everything runs on technology now. Responsibilities to users and organizations is to provide quality error free work that meets all requirements asked.
